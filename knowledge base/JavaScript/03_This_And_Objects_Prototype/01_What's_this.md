`This` is a runtime binding. 

`This` is contextual based on the conditions of the function's invocation. `this` binding has nothing to do with where a function was declared, but instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is invoked. 

When a function is invoked, an activation record called context, is created. This context contains information about arguments and other. One of parameters of the context is `this` reference.


## Call-site

A call-site is a place where a function is called from.
