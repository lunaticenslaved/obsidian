There are two main scope models: Lexical Scope and Dynamic Scope.


### Lexical Scope

The first phase of standard compiler is called lexing. So the scopes defined in that stage is called lexical scopes.

**The lexing process examines a string of source code characters and assigns semantic meaning to the tokens as a result of some stateful parsing.**

### Look-ups

When Engine searches for some variable it asks Scope find the first match.

**No matter where a function is invoked from, or how it is invoked. Its lexical scope is only defined by where the function is declared.**



### Cheating Lexical

There are two ways to update lexical scope it runtime. **Both of them are bad practices and lead to poorer perfomance.**

#### eval

```
function foo(str) { 
	"use strict"; 
	eval( str ); 
	console.log( a ); // ReferenceError: a is not defined 
} 

foo( "var a = 2" );
```


#### with

```
function foo(obj) { 
	with (obj) {
		a = 2; 
	} 
} 

var o1 = { a: 3 }; 
var o2 = { b: 3 }; 

foo( o1 ); console.log( o1.a ); // 2 

foo( o2 ); console.log( o2.a ); // undefined 

console.log( a ); // 2â€”Oops, leaked global!
```
