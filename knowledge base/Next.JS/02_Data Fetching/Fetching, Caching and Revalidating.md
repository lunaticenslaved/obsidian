## Fetching on the Server with `fetch`

You can fetch data on the server with `fetch` function. The function is extended to allow you to configure caching and revalidating behavior.

You can use `cookies()` and `headers()` function but in this case the route becames dynamic.


#### Caching Data

The data can be cached at build time or request time. The data is stores in Data Cache - a persistent [HTTP Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching)


#### Revalidating Data

Revalidating is the process of purging the Data Cache ans re-fetching the latest data.

There are two ways of revalitating:

- **Time-based revalidation** - refresh data after the certain amount of time has passed. Use when the data changes infrequently.
- **On-demand revalidation** - manually revalidate data when something has happened. On-demand revalidation can be use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate a banch of data at once. 

###### Time-based revalidation

Revalidate data in time intervals:
```
fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
```

**If you have multiple fetch requests in a statically rendered route, and each has a different revalidation frequency. The lowest time will be used for all requests. For dynamically rendered routes, each `fetch` request will be revalidated independently.**


###### On-demand revalidation

You can revalidate data by using `revalidatePath` (for page routes) or `revalidateTag` inside server actions or route handler.

You can set tags like this:
```
export default async function Page() {
  const res = await fetch('https://...', { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })
  const data = await res.json()
  // ...
}
```


###### Error while revalidating

If an error occurs while revalidating the latest valid data will be stored in cache.


#### Opting out of Data Caching

`fetch` requests are **not** cached if:

- The `cache: 'no-store'` is added to `fetch` requests.
- The `revalidate: 0` option is added to individual `fetch` requests.
- The `fetch` request is inside a Router Handler that uses the `POST` method.
- The `fetch` request comes after the usage of `headers` or `cookies`.
- The `const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` route segment option is used.
- The `fetchCache` route segment option is configured to skip cache by default.
- The `fetch` request uses `Authorization` or `Cookie` headers and there's an uncached request above it in the component tree.

###### Individual `fetch` requests

```
fetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' })
```

######  Multiple `fetch` requests

You can configure behaviour of multiple requests with the [Segment Config Options](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config).


### Fetching data on the Server with third-party libraries

You can configure cache policy with  the [Segment Config Options](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) or with [React `cache` function](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache).
